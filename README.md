This repo hosts the static website for Professor John Pandolfi's Marine Palaeoecology Lab. Our lab worked on sovereign Aboriginal Country in Magandjin for decades, and we conducted research on many different First Peoples' Country and Sea Country. We acknowledge the Traditional Owners and Custodians of these places. Always was, always will be.

Our website used to live over at [marinepalaeoecology.org](http://marinepalaeoecology.org/). We moved all the information from this site over to [marinepalaeoecology.github.io](https://marinepalaeoecology.github.io/) in September 2025. We used a [template](https://marvin-schmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/index.html) to help create this GitHub-hosted website: thank you to Marvin Schmitt. 

If you have any questions, please reach out to [Prof John Pandolfi](mailto:j.pandolfi@uq.edu.au) (for science-y questions) or [Emer Cunningham](mailto:e.cunningham@uqconnect.edu.au) (for GitHub-website-y questions).
