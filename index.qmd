**Welcome to Professor John Pandolfi's lab at The University of Queensland (UQ), Magandjin.**

In the Marine Palaeoecology Lab, we investigate the effects of natural and anthropogenic climate change, as well as other anthropogenic stressors, on tropical coral reef and sub-tropical habitats. We use a number of tools to study marine change across wide ecological and temporal scales, encompassing genetic studies, modern ecological field work, historical surveys, and analysis of fossil assemblages.

Coral reefs are experiencing increasing degradations, but systematic studies of these underwater environments are only recent. To understand how these environments lived before human influence, we need to be creative in the use of tools that give us an insight into the recent past (hundreds to thousands of years) as well as the deep past (hundreds of thousands to millions of years). Using our wide ecological and temporal toolset, we work to establish appropriate baselines for the study and management of marine ecosystems.

Subtropical reef communities may be instrumental for the survival of coral reef organisms through geological time and act as refuges for tropical corals. In the Marine Palaeoecology Lab we are studying how coral reefs and other marine communities adapt to different environments over latitudinal gradients using approaches that will help us understand the past of coral reefs and give us a better perspective of their future under climate change.

Our state of the art facilities include a dedicated space for genetic studies including PCR and gel electrophoresis equipment, several dissecting and stereoscopic microscopes, a Micro-CT scan and a dedicated coring lab. We have a collection of more than 600 sediment cores collected on a 14 degree latitudinal gradient on the east coast of so-called Australia, from Quandamooka (Moreton Bay) to far north Queensland. Our fossil collection include corals, foraminifera and other marine invertebrates across the Great Ocean (i.e., in the Indo-Pacific region) and cover a timeline from hundreds to millions of years.
