    "text": "Tara R. Clark is a geochemist and marine palaeoecologist in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Queensland. Tara received a Bachelor of Science (Hons) at the University of New England, Armidale, and a PhD from the University of Queensland, Brisbane.\nTara’s early and current research is primarily focused on human impacts on the marine environment. After the completion of her undergraduate studies in 2005, she investigated the effects of nutrient enrichment on seagrass macroinvertebrate communities during Honours at the National Marine Science Centre in Coffs Harbour. The importance of this study was reflected in the need to assess the effects of increasing nutrient enrichment in coastal waters, from point and non-point sources, as a result of human population expansion and increased urban development on the NSW mid-north coast.\nTara is now continuing to work on historical ecological and environmental changes on the GBR as a Research Officer on the National Environmental Research Program (NERP) funded project ‘Characterising the cumulative impacts of global, regional and local stressors on the present and past biodiversity of the GBR’.\n\n\nCurrent research\nDuring her doctoral research, Tara investigated the history of mortality events of inshore reef coral communities within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) since European settlement. While the GBR is considered to be one of the least degraded coral reefs in the world, increasing evidence suggests that this may not be the case with a 50.7% loss of coral cover since 1985 on mid-shelf and offshore reefs (see De’ath et al. 2012 PNAS 109: 17995-17999). With detailed knowledge of the GBR limited to the past 25yrs, little is known of the past changes in coral communities since European settlement and the onset of anthropogenic disturbance. This research used highly precise uranium-series (U-series) thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC ICP-MS) dating of dead Acropora coral rubble (death assemblage) and massive Porites from inshore reef environments influenced by terrestrial runoff and high sea surface temperatures, to provide an accurate chronology on the timing of historical mortality events prior to the advent of long-term monitoring. Such baseline knowledge is critical when assessing the current status of the GBR and setting restoration targets.\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nPeer-reviewed papers\nRoff G, Clark T, Reymond C, Zhao J, Feng Y, McCook LJ, Pandolfi JM. 2013.

Steve received a PhD in Marine Science and Management from the University of New England, Armidale NSW.\nSteve has extensive knowledge of marine habitats along the NSW and southern QLD coastline and is currently undertaking research focussed on assessing the potential for tropical coral species migration to higher latitudes and understanding the mechanisms that enable warm water coral specialist to grow and persist at marginal reefs along the eastern seaboard. This work aims to assess the influence of elemental stoichiometry in corals and their symbionts in determining how changes in metabolic rates might define latitudinal limits in the distribution of reef corals.\nSteve is committed to understanding the implications of threats to subtropical marine environments, which will help to develop management strategies and educational programs to ensure future reef stability and longevity. Steve’s contribution to local projects, which engage community and government agency support, continue to build on the region’s capacity to undertake marine research.\n\n\nEducation\nResearch Scientist, Shark Research, Department of Primary Industries, Coffs Harbour NSW\nPost-doctoral Research Fellow, Southern Cross University, Coffs Harbour NSW\nPhD, University of New England, Armidale, NSW\nFirst Class Honours, University of New England, Armidale NSW\n\n\n\nCurrent research\nSteve’s PhD research focused on assessing threats to subtropical marine communities, with particular emphasis on hard corals associated with reefs throughout northern New South Wales. This research identified an infectious disease that was termed Australian Subtropical White Syndrome. It provided a comprehensive assessment of the impact thermal stress and disease had on hard coral communities throughout the region. These observations established baseline data for comparison following a significant coral-bleaching event at Lord Howe Island (LHI) in 2010. A current collaborative project is assessing the resilience potential of hard corals to combat repeated thermal stress events. This ongoing research at LHI is the first project to document the impacts of successive thermal bleaching events and will provide important information regarding the ability of thermally vulnerable coral species to persist in a warmer climate, where bleaching episodes are predicted to occur annually by 2050.\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nHughes, T.P., Dalton, S.

The subtropical-to-temperate transition zones in eastern Australia and Japan harbour a unique combination of tropical, subtropical and temperate taxa, including corals at their high-latitude range limits. Primarily non-reefal coral communities occur in pockets of suitable habitat and extend to high latitudes. They are regarded as potential refuge habitats for tropical species as they become threatened by global warming, however increased ecological understanding of the mechanism that structure them is required before these and similar questions can be properly assessed. My research aims to address some of these knowledge gaps.

However, without an understanding of historical ecological baselines, fisheries managers underestimate exploited fish population abundance and status.My research focuses on using historical, social and ecological techniques to provide baselines of former population sizes against which current populations can be benchmarked. This study will integrate long-term patterns of change in fisheries abundance and distribution, analysis of the relative impacts of resource user groups (commercial, recreational and Indigenous) and statistical models to identify whether exploited fish populations are managed at sustainable levels. Specifically this research aims to: 1) track the trajectory of a suite of Moreton Bay fin fisheries abundances since the Holocene; 2) reconstruct the history of the Australian east coast Spanish mackerel fishery as a specific case study to determine the relative impact of both commercial and recreational fishing sectors over time; and 3) assessing Kenya’s historically exploited coral reef fish species susceptibility to extinction.This project will be the first to provide a long-term reconstruction and baseline of exploited Queensland’s fish populations using an interdisciplinary approach. It will contribute to a broader understanding of fisheries and provide important baseline information for managers concerned about maintaining fishery resources at a sustainable level.\n\n\n\nQualifications\nAcademic Tutor – University of Queensland, Australia\nSeabird Research Assistant – Department of Conservation, New Zealand\nCanine Supervisor – SPCA, New Zealand\nFisheries Observer – Ministry of Fisheries New Zealand\nZoology Teacher – Seoul, South KoreaSarah driving\nMarine Researcher – Irish and Celtic Seas, University College Cork\nHonours BSc in Zoology – University College Cork\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nDoyle, T.

The population forms a large spawning aggregation, where hundreds of sexually mature individuals of this and two other charismatic species converge en-masse to participate in spectacular displays of courtship. In addition to their natural and aesthetic value, spawning aggregations are particularly valuable to local fisher communities, for both subsistence and income. Unfortunately, aggregations are also extremely vulnerable to overfishing, and slow to recover. Through unsustainable fishing and ineffective management, around 80% of studied spawning aggregations worldwide are in decline or have disappeared entirely, devastating local communities and coral reef ecosystems. This project will utilise new and existing partnerships, and proven scientific techniques, to fill vital knowledge gaps about adult movement patterns, larval replenishment, population demographics and local socioeconomic conditions to facilitate the sustainable management of this high-value, charismatic species.\nSupervisors: Dr Glenn Almany (James Cook University), Dr Joshua Cinner (JCU), Dr Richard Hamilton (The Nature Conservancy) & Prof John Pandolfi (UQ)\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nWaldie PA, Blomberg SP, Cheney KL, Goldizen AW, Grutter AS (2011) Long-Term Effects of the Cleaner Fish Labroides dimidiatus on Coral Reef Fish Communities.

To optimise persistence and preservation of ocean biodiversity and mitigate these threats, a number of approaches are used (Devillers et al. 2014; Hays et al. 2014). Most important of these are marine protected areas (MPAs); regarded as a long-term strategy and policy tool in conserving marine biodiversity and ecosystem function (Coleman et al. 2013; Cvitanovic et al. 2013; Grorud-Colvert et al. 2014). Nonetheless, seldom are decisions regarding MPA designation made on the basis of scientific and biological considerations only (Allison et al. 1998; Roberts 2000; Joppa & Pfaff 2009; Dulvy 2013; Devillers et al. 2014). The influence of many political and socio-economic goals and constraints has biased designation of MPAs, as decision makers attempt to minimise costs and impacts on resource users (Edgar et al. 2008; Devillers et al. 2014). Furthermore, there is an identified gap between conservation theory and practice, and scientific uncertainty about whether conservation objectives are being achieved or interventions effective (Pullin & Knight 2001; Lisbon de Loma et al. 2008; Miteva et al. 2012). The evidence base for the effectiveness of MPAs in conserving biodiversity is limited, with few existing MPAs critically evaluated for their current or future biological impacts (Ferraro & Pattanayak 2006; Miteva et al. 2012).\nMy research firstly aims to examine to what extent MPAs, through their use as a policy and strategy tool, integrates with other international, national and state marine policy and legislation, and conservation initiatives such as threatened species recovery plans, to support and conserve our most vulnerable species. Secondly, I aim to assess the chronological expansion of MPA systems, in Australia and other countries, and appraise their “residual bias”, i.e., bias in their designation to areas least valuable for extractive uses such as oil and gas exploration, and fisheries. This research will also determine the impact of residual bias in Australia’s marine reserve system on species of conservation concern. Finally, I aim to determine how best to evaluate the biological impacts of MPAs, develop a framework for use in this process, and determine what evidence is needed to support the effectiveness of conservation interventions, such as no-take zones within MPAs.\nSupervisors: Prof John M. Pandolfi (UQ) & Prof Bob Pressey (JCU)"

Predicting and managing for such changes requires a long-term ecological perspective of ecosystem variability and adaptability. As an ecological archive of geohistorical data, the fossil record provides this temporal perspective. Therefore, using the fossil record, this project tested hypotheses related to the timing, trends, and drivers of ecosystem development, assemblage composition, and species distributions of scleractinian corals during the Middle – Late Pleistocene. This time interval is significant because it represents a time when the Earth’s climate was in a state of transition and environmental change.\nThe Middle – Late Pleistocene (~1.0 – 0.01 Ma) climate is characterized by the intensification of cyclic oscillations between glacial (cool, low sea level) and interglacial (warm, high sea level) intervals. The fossil record, preserving a long-term dataset of coral reef communities composed of extant species, reveals that reef corals have persisted throughout the Pleistocene despite these multiple dramatic climate fluctuations, some of which are similar in magnitude to modern climate change. Although it provides a valuable ecologic resource, the Early – Late Pleistocene history of coral reef ecology remains largely unexplored, particularly in relation to climate changes during this critical period of reef expansion, and persistence, into modern reef ecosystems.\nOverall, this thesis identified long-term ecological trends in shallow-water coral ecosystem development and deep-water coral diversity and distribution in relation to local, regional, and or global environmental variables during the Middle – Late Pleistocene, when the amplitude of glacial-interglacial cycles were intensifying into the modern climate regime. These results provide new insights to the natural variability of coral ecosystems and their capacity to respond to environmental conditions or changes operating on local to global scales. Such knowledge may improve our predictions about the future of coral ecosystems and their ability to cope with current and anticipated environmental changes.\nSupervisors: Prof John M.

Modification of coastal habitats and intense agriculture resulted in increased runoff into adjacent rivers and estuarine waterways, subsequently polluting the GBR. This agricultural waste has caused eutrophication and terrigenous sedimentation, resulting in decreased water quality. In response to this, coral reefs have undergone rapid degradation. This project aims to investigate whether bioeroders have increased in abundance and diversity, both spatially and temporally, across a water quality gradient on the GBR, relative to anthropogenic perturbations. We expect to find that abundance and diversity of bioeroders increased with decreasing water quality, both through time as a result of European colonisation and across space as a result of nearshore proximity."

We use a number of tools to study marine change across wide ecological and temporal scales, encompassing genetic studies, modern ecological field work, historical surveys, and analysis of fossil assemblages.\nCoral reefs are experiencing increasing degradations, but systematic studies of these underwater environments are only recent. To understand how these environments lived before human influence, we need to be creative in the use of tools that give us an insight into the recent past (hundreds to thousands of years) as well as the deep past (hundreds of thousands to millions of years). Using our wide ecological and temporal toolset, we work to establish appropriate baselines for the study and management of marine ecosystems.\nSubtropical reef communities may be instrumental for the survival of coral reef organisms through geological time and act as refuges for tropical corals. In the Marine Palaeoecology Lab we are studying how coral reefs and other marine communities adapt to different environments over latitudinal gradients using approaches that will help us understand the past of coral reefs and give us a better perspective of their future under climate change.\nOur state of the art facilities include a dedicated space for genetic studies including PCR and gel electrophoresis equipment, several dissecting and stereoscopic microscopes, a Micro-CT scan and a dedicated coring lab. We have a collection of more than 600 sediment cores collected on a 14 degree latitudinal gradient on the east coast of so-called Australia, from Quandamooka (Moreton Bay) to far north Queensland.

My proposed study will apply a modern quantitative detection framework to a contemporary time series database to detect taxonomic and functional novelty in freshwater fish communities on a global scale. With this, I aim to better understand how trait changes contribute to novelty and determine whether considering community-level trait changes is beneficial for improving our understanding of ecological novelty."

This agricultural waste has caused eutrophication and terrigenous sedimentation, resulting in decreased water quality. In response to this, coral reefs have undergone rapid degradation. This project aims to investigate whether bioeroders have increased in abundance and diversity, both spatially and temporally, across a water quality gradient on the GBR, relative to anthropogenic perturbations.

In Moreton Bay (27º25’S, 152º20’E), Australia, commercial and recreational fishing activities have intensified since the onset of European settlement, nearly 200 years ago. However, the total impacts that these practices have had on fish communities are difficult to discern due to the lack of understanding of long-term historical baselines. To recognise the major drivers of ecological change and degradation of coastal marine ecosystems, whether natural and/or anthropogenic, requires an understanding of the baseline or natural conditions prior to any major anthropogenic exploitation. To determine the baseline conditions of fish community structure in a marine ecosystem, a useful ecological indicator is needed. This study uses microscopic fish teeth as a proxy to reconstruct the baseline structure of fish functional groups in Moreton Bay, Southeast Queensland, Australia, prior to and post European settlement. Fish teeth were picked from core and surface sediments from three sites across Moreton Bay (Wellington Point, Peel Island and Myora Reef) to analyse patterns in temporal and spatial scales of fish functional groups. We found a general increase in the number of fish teeth in more recent sediment samples, highlighting possible taphonomic (preservational) effects. No significant difference in fish community structure was observed among sites in Moreton Bay. However, a significant temporal change in the relative abundance of functional groups was observed: 1) between 0CE to 999CE and 1000CE to 1999CE; and 2) between 2000BCE to 1001BCE and 1000CE to 1999CE. Fishing activities in the past 2000 years in Moreton Bay appear to have had minimal impacts on the functional structure of fish communities; however, the impact of changing environmental conditions, resulting in variation in coral reef accretion, may be a likely factor influencing the changes in functional composition of fish communities through time."

This study provides the first time-series comparison of catch and effort in Moreton Bay’s mixed-species recreational fishery, focusing on; Sillago maculata (diver whiting), Pagrus auratus (pink snapper), and Portunus armatus (blue swimmer crab). Access-point surveys were undertaken in Moreton Bay in 2013, and compared with surveys conducted using the same methodology in 1994/1995 and 1999. Diver whiting catch rates have significantly declined over the time-series, despite a regulatory change banning this species in commercial trawler bycatch, which was expected to increase productivity and catch rate. Snapper catch rates were consistent between 1994 and 2013, however a significantly greater catch rate in 1999 may have captured a ‘pulse’ increase in snapper abundance. Hyperstability could be occurring in this snapper fishery, with anglers potentially fishing down a declining stock. Size structure of snapper and diver whiting showed greater proportions in larger size classes in 2013 than past years, which for snapper is likely due to restrictive size limits. Mean length of the two species has significantly increased over time. Blue swimmer crabs showed opposite trends, with smaller proportions in larger size classes and a smaller mean carapace width in 2013. Human dimensions of these fisheries were examined in 2013, providing a baseline for future research. This study highlights the importance of time-series comparisons in identifying temporal trends, and may assist in sustainable management of recreational fisheries and fish stocks."

To explore the effects of both anthropogenic processes including, land-­use change, urban and industrial growth and natural process including ENSO, rainfall, weathering and sea level variation on the environments of Moreton Bay, the geochemical analyses of four massive corals from the bay was conducted. The geochemical analysis of annual growth bands of coral colonies of species Favia speciosa and Plesiastrea versipora using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-­MS), allowed for the development of a proxy record of environmental change in Moreton Bay spanning from 1942 to the present. Cores of a Plesiastrea versipora from Peel Island and a Favia speciosa from Goat and Peel Island were collected on the 28/6/2011. A core sample of a Favia speciosa collected from Wellington Point in 1997 and a fossil of the same species from Cleveland Point were also incorporated into this study. Trends in trace metals (Mn, Zn, Sn, Cu, Fe, Pb, rare earth elements, and yttrium concentrations (La Ce Pr Nd Sm Eu Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu and Y) were measured, with chronologies developed from X-­ray densitometry and U-­Th dating. Annual trends in metal concentration were highly variable, with few long-­term trends. Comparisons of rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) concentrations in coral cores from western and eastern Moreton Bay indicated a strong terrestrial-­marine environmental gradient characterized by hypo-­saline turbid waters in western Moreton Bay at Wellington Point to more oceanic water in eastern Moreton Bay at Peel and Goat Island. Decadal REY oscillations measured in P. versipora where predominantly driven by rainfall variation in the Brisbane river catchment, resulting in decadal trends of decreased river influence in southern Moreton Bay between 1942 and 2011. Completion of Wivenhoe Dam in the upper Brisbane river catchment in 1981 resulted in a decrease in discharge variability of the Brisbane River. This is shown in a drop in total REY concentrations in modern corals of Eastern Moreton Bay. Sea level rise is also discussed as potential driver of this decrease. Mid-­Holocene (6ka) Cleveland point was characterized by high river influence comparable with modern Wellington point, but with less environmental variability through time. This study highlights the strong environmental gradients in the bay, driven by tidal currents and catchment process, and their possible interaction with biological aspects of the Bay, including the potential for localized coral growth."

Before this breaking point, calcification is driven by sea surface temperature showing an inverse relationship trend. It is possible that the effect of European settlement on calcification could be explained among other by sedimentation and river discharge. Also the end of the LIA announced drastic changes in temperature. This period is a transition between a cold period and global warming. However the response of corals is still to discover yet."

We sampled the relative species abundance of coral, benthic foraminifera, and calcareous red algae communities from eight submerged coral reefs in the Huon Gulf, Papua New Guinea, which formed during successive sea level fall and lowstand periods over the past ;416 kyr. We found that dissimilarity in coral species composition increased significantly with increasing time between reef-building events. However, neither coral diversity nor the taxonomic composition of benthic foraminifera and calcareous red algae assemblages varied significantly over time. The taxonomic composition of coral communities from lowstand reefs was significantly different from that of highstand reefs previously reported from the nearby Huon Peninsula. We interpret the community composition and temporal dynamics of lowstand reefs as a result of shifting energy regimes in the Huon Gulf, and differences between low and highstand reefs as a result of differences in the interaction between biotic and environmental factors between the Huon Gulf and Huon Peninsula. Regardless of the exact processes driving these trends, our study represents the first glimpse into the ecological dynamics of coral reefs during low sea level stands when climatic conditions for reef growth were much different and less optimal than during previously studied highstand periods."

Tissue sourced from predominately juvenile white sharks of five Australian regions was sequenced for the mtDNA control region and genotyped with six nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci. Maternally inherited population structure was found between all regions, suggesting regional natal philopatry, and was also found between the east and south/west coasts, which concords with recent tracking data from satellite and acoustic tags, that indicates the presence of east coast white shark nurseries. Finding genetic population subdivision with both maternally and bi-parentally inherited markers suggests that both genders exhibit degrees of regional philopatry and that males are not panmictic as previously supposed. In contrast, five sharks captured on the east coast proved to have haplotypes that resemble western Indian Ocean sharks more closely than Australian and New Zealand sharks. Estimates of long-term genetic effective population size from microsatellite loci indicate that an extensive ancestral white shark population once existed. Contemporary estimates of genetic effective population size suggest a breeding population in Australian waters greater than commonly accepted thresholds for inbreeding and loss of adaptive potential. However, unmonitored population decline could expose these genetically populations isolated to precipitous loss of genetic diversity. Therefore, we suggest that the current level of international and regional protection of white sharks is appropriate but that populations should be investigated in more detail."

    "text": "Current research\nEcology and paleoecology of Indo-Pacific coral reefs (Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea)\nReef decline, with regional loss of diversity, abundance and habitat structure has been observed worldwide. Long-term baselines and understanding of reef processes through the use of paleoecological tools can provide vital understanding of the trajectories of modern reefs. The Coral Triangle within the Indo-Pacific region is identified as an area of both highest coral diversity and highest abundance of corals under extinction risk. This thesis examines the patterns of association between disturbance regimes, taxonomic composition, growth forms and taphonomy of two coral communities in the southeast corner of the Coral Triangle: the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. The immediate impact of cyclones on coral communities is apparent and well studied. To better understand the potential implications of increasing cyclone frequency due to rising sea surface temperatures (SST), I examined coral community composition throughout a 49-year cyclone history in the Solomon Islands. Increasing cyclone frequency decreases the abundance of branching and massive corals and increases the abundance of encrusting corals, potentially causing a flattening of the reef. The reefs found in areas that received an intermediate number of cyclones had higher species richness than reefs in areas receiving either high or low numbers of cyclones. If currently predicted increases in SST result in increases in cyclone frequency, we predict a flattening of reef morphology. To determine the quality of the fossil record for baseline assessments, I compared fossil (Pleistocene and Holocene) with modern coral data using paleoecological reconstructions. The raised fossil and modern reefs of the Solomon Islands had similar growth form composition, but there was a significant difference in taxonomic composition between them. The similarity in growth form composition indicates a reduced impact from time averaging and taphonomic bias in these reefs, and the significant differences in taxonomic composition and several diversity measures are interpreted to be due to natural or anthropogenic change. The results of this study illustrate the usefulness of raised fossil reefs as indicators of past reef environments and as benchmarks with which to evaluate modern reefs, especially those in shallow fringing reef environments. To determine whether coral community composition influences reef accretion rate (net calcium carbonate production after bioerosion and off reef transport), I used community structure and radiometric age data from Holocene coral communities exposed in seven sites along the Huon Peninsula in Papua New Guinea. A geographic gradient was found in both the rates of accretion and the coral taxonomic composition. However, the abundances of the main framework building coral genera showed no significant relationship with accretion rates. This indicates that an environmental factor, possibly wave damage, is influencing the taxonomic composition and reef accretion rates separately. I found no evidence that taxonomic composition has direct control over reef accretion rates. I recommend that studies of both fossil and modern reef accretion should not focus solely on taxonomic composition or dominant framework builder as the primary driver of reef accretion rates. This thesis aids in understanding the role of coral taxonomic and growth form composition in regards to reef accretion, time and cyclone frequency. The results of this study help to: 1) develop a reef history in the Solomon Islands which has been identified as an area with high reef diversity that should be well managed; 2) explain the relationship between reef accretion and taxonomic composition, highlighting the importance of evaluating impacts on reef accretion at the community level; and 3) provide an understanding how cyclone frequency affects coral community structure in order to better predict the impact any increase in cyclone frequency will have on coral reefs."

    "text": "Current research\nHistorical ecology and experimental biology of foraminifera from the inshore Great Barrier Reef, Australia\nThis thesis focuses on historical patterns in community structure, present effects of nutrification, and future consequences of ocean acidification and nutrification on photosymbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. In the initial section of my thesis I investigated the natural range of variability in community structure of inshore benthic foraminiferal communities adjacent to the Burdekin River throughout the last millennium. Secondly, I examined the growth response of Marginopora vertebralis (a large photosymbiont-bearing foraminifera) to increase terrestrially derived nitrogen and phosphate under both field and laboratory conditions along a known water quality gradient within the Whitsunday Islands, GBR. Thirdly, I investigated the effects of both high nutrients and lowered pH (and their interaction) on M. vertebralis growth and productivity using projected scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In summary, inshore reef ecosystems, particularly those adjacent to major river runoff, are vulnerable to increased nutrification and sedimentation. The resultant spatial gradients in water quality provide an ideal natural experiment to assess the ecology and physiology of benthic foraminifera. In addition to declining water quality, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is predicted to have major impact on marine calcifying organisms such as foraminifera. Awareness of the natural variability of past community structure enables the understanding of baselines to assess the ecological and physiological response to present day and future scenarios. As foraminifera are a well-established biological indicator of ecological status, the assessment of past benthic foraminiferal communities provides strong evidence for community persistence. The host and algae physiology argues that reduced nutrient runoff can have beneficial outcomes for the growth success of benthic photosymbiont-bearing M. vertebralis. Furthermore, the additive effect of nutrification and climate change may hinder future skeletal growth and photosynthetic productivity. In conclusion, high levels of similarity were observed in benthic foraminifera communities over a centennial to millennial timescale. The contrast in community structure between sites is evidently due to differences in water quality and supports the idea that photosymbiotic species hold an advantage in oligotrophic water compared to water with high terrestrial runoff. However, the advantage of harbouring photosymbionts appears to be compromised with close proximity to river run off and under future scenarios of ocean acidification. Therefore, shifts in functional abundance may occur when photosymbiosis becomes less advantageous as physiochemical conditions change."

    "text": "Current research\nHistorical ecology of coral communities from the inshore Great Barrier Reef\nTrajectories of decline have been described in coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region, with long-term losses of abundance, diversity and habitat structure. Since European settlement of the Queensland coastline in the mid-18th century, widespread changes in land use have occurred within Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments (e.g. extensive land clearing, agriculture and grazing). Despite direct and indirect evidence indicating decline of inshore reefs, it has proven difficult to ascertain links between land use changes, terrestrial discharge, water quality and the decline of coral reefs at regional scales, and the contributions of anthropogenic influences to the disturbance regimes of inshore reefs remains highly controversial. This thesis uses palaeoecological reconstruction of coral assemblages and high-precision U-Series dating to examine changes in community structure of inshore coral reefs in the Palm Islands region across decadal and centennial scales. Comparisons of modern and historical coral assemblages provide evidence of a collapse of Acropora coral communities at Pelorus Reef in the early 20th Century. Fossil assemblages in an adjacent site at Pelorus provide further evidence of an extrinsic shift from historical Acropora assemblages to more sediment-tolerant corals in modern assemblages, a change without precedence in 800 years of record. Sediment cores (2-5m length) were extracted from Pandora and Havannah reefs to determine long-term rates of reef growth throughout the late Holocene. Computer Axial Tomography (CAT) scans of cores revealed a framework dominated by coral fragments, and U-Series dating of corals revealed rapid and continuous reef growth at both reefs throughout the last 1000 yrs. Comparisons of reef accretion (m ka-1) from cores with published accretion rates from early-mid Holocene inshore GBR reefs show that reef slope environments are now accreting at rates equal to and exceeding those of the last 8000 years. This result contradicts assumptions that inshore reefs are undergoing or have undergone natural trajectories of geomorphic decline. A bayesian approach to determine stability of coral communities from the Pandora and Havannah cores indicates that those coral communities have existed in stable states for upwards of 400yrs, punctuated by periods of instability. Contrary to some paradigms of biodiversity, the high diversity communities were unstable on centennial scales, 4 yet the low diversity assemblages did not necessarily confer stability to these assemblages. Growth rates of inshore reefs were independent of diversity or community structure. From a management perspective, these results provide a longer-term (decades to centuries) understanding of coral community dynamics on inshore reefs of the GBR that provides a basis for detecting and understanding changes following European settlement, and a baseline for the management and potential restoration of coral communities at local and regional scales."

    "text": "Current research\nEvolutionary Dynamics of Indo – Pacific Reef Corals throughout the Neogene\nThe origin of marine biodiversity in the Indo-Pacific is poorly known. Faunal turnover in scleractinian reef corals has been hypothesised over the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (~5 Ma), in the Malay Archipelago. However, there is little information available on origination and extinction events in reef corals during the same period for the broader Indo-Pacific region. This is important because many species probably had a wider distribution than previously thought, and many more genera than has previously been estimated were probably present in the Indo-Pacific during the Neogene.\nHere I begin to fill the gap in our knowledge by reporting on the taxonomic composition and diversity of Neogene reef coral communities sampled from Indonesia (Salayar), Papua New Guinea (New Britain), and Fiji (Vanua Balavu). Sampling locations were chosen on their reported age, fossil content and preservation quality. Ages were refined using foraminiferal assemblages and Strontium 87/86 isotope ages of samples collected at the sampling locations. This dual approach confirms a middle Miocene to early Pleistocene age range for the collection.\nI described 155 species of reef forming corals collected across an Indo-Pacific longitudinal gradient. Twenty-two constitute new, extinct species from the genera Alveopora, Astreopora, Caulastrea, Cyphastrea, Echinopora, Euphyllia, Galaxea, Leptoria, Leptoseris, Madracis, Montipora, Platygyra, Symphyllia and Turbinaria. A further 42 taxa could not be assigned to species level due to poor preservation, but may well be additional new, extinct species.\nI uncovered a general pattern of coral turnover across the Indo-Pacific by investigating the degree to which coral communities (using both presence/absence and relative abundance of both coral species and genera) varied with water depth, time and geographical distribution. Coral communities were found to vary with global sea level and time. Thus global changes in sea level through time potentially drove extinction and origination in Indo-Pacific Neogene corals.\nInverse Lyellian analysis indicates that of species present in the Miocene in New Britain, a mean of 41.8% are now extinct, possibly resulting from restricted flow of oceanic currents in that region. Indonesia (mean = 9.4%); and Fiji (mean = 6.6%) both had significantly lower proportions of extinct species. However, there is a decline in the number of extinct species found at any location from the middle Miocene (mean = 23.2%) to the early Pleistocene (mean = 1.8%). This study supports previously proposed models of an early Pliocene turnover event in Scleractinia in the Indo-Pacific."

Reef-dwelling species of benthic foraminifera are important marine calcifiers, and fundamental for reef sediment formation and accretion. They are sensitive to multiple anthropogenic and natural environmental stressors, and respond consistently to changes in environmental conditions. Understanding how benthic foraminifera populations respond to these changes, and their adaptation/acclimation potential, is crucial for predicting the effects of ongoing global environmental change in local populations on the Great Barrier Reef.\nHere, I focus on the impacts of ocean warming, acidification and nitrification in the responses of reef-dwelling species using a multi-scale approach: biochemical, physiological and population scale. Specifically, I investigated: (1) how species of photosymbiont-bearing foraminifera with different calcification mechanisms (Amphistegina lessonii and Marginopora vertebralis) respond to changes in pH levels; (2) the effects of local habitat in shaping the responses of a photosymbiont-bearing species Amphistegina lobifera collected from distinct reef locations to changing conditions of temperature, light and nitrate levels; and (3) how the sensitivity of photosymbiont-bearing foraminifera to changes in water quality can ultimately be detected in past foraminiferal communities retrieved from reef-matrix cores.\nThe effects of ocean acidification, warming and nitrification resulted in significant divergent responses, likely driven by types of calcification mechanism and adaptation to the local environment. Different light levels sparked a similar response across all populations tested, suggesting that the ability of photosymbiont-bearing foraminifera to regulate light exposure through cryptic behaviour is independent of their local habitat. Reduced water pH caused severe disruption to the growth and calcification process in A. lessonii, whereas M. vertebralis was able to inhibit or activate enzymes in order to survive at low pH levels. Elevated temperature and light levels induced oxidative stress in A. lobifera, likely related to photosynthesis in the endosymbionts. However, those individuals from variable environments were able to recover and avoid further cellular damage and mortality. Addition of nitrate induced bleaching and mortality in those populations adapted to oligotrophic conditions, but increased the activity of enzymes related to growth and calcification in A. lobifera individuals that experience seasonal pulses of nutrient input.\nAnalysis of benthic foraminiferal communities over a 300 years period (from ~1701 to 2012) at inshore reefs of High and Russell Islands (central GBR) revealed that while both populations were currently dominated by heterotrophic taxa, this was not always the case. At Russell Island, the foraminiferal community showed a steady decline in photosymbiont-bearing taxa since the late 1800s, resulting in a shift from photosymbiont-bearing to heterotroph dominated in ~1950. In contrast, populations from High Island were always dominated by heterotrophic taxa, with a significant steady contribution of photosymbiont-bearing genera through time. This finding indicates that greater and more consistent volumes of terrestrial runoff over time occurred in this area compared to Russell Island. At Russell Island, the shift in favour of heterotrophic taxa was likely due to changes in the local water quality conditions. Runoff causes a reduction in light levels and higher amounts of organic matter and nutrients, benefiting heterotrophic feeding modes. Trace element/Ca (TE/Ca) ratios of foraminifera tests reflected the influence of terrestrial runoff over time, and resulting shifts in water quality. The recorded patterns of change in both community composition, and TE/Ca ratios, coincide with the introduction of industrialised farming around the Russell-Mulgrave River catchment, with a corresponding, and continued decline in water quality around High and Russell Islands.\nThis study demonstrated that photosymbiont-bearing foraminifera are sensitive to localised declines in water quality, as well as the effects of global climate change, but those populations that are naturally adapted to variable conditions are able to acclimate to shifts in environmental conditions by regulating biochemical functions within and above their threshold of tolerance. As a result, foraminifera populations from inshore reefs that are chronically subjected to inputs of terrestrial runoff are able to persist through time, whereas populations adapted to more stable, oligotrophic conditions are likely to experience shifts in species composition, from communities dominated by photosymbiont-bearing taxa, to communities abundant in heterotrophic/stress-tolerant species.\nSupervisors: Prof John M.

    "text": "Current research\nBenthic foraminifera as Holocene to Recent indicators in marginal marine environments: modern distribution and the palaeoecological response to environmental changes in Moreton Bay, southeastern Queensland, Australia\nEstuarine embayments and coastal areas occurring adjacent to large, populated river catchments are presently threatened by multiple anthropogenic and natural environmental stressors, including: intense human activities, overharvesting, coastal land modification, sediment/nutrient and pollutant input, storms, flooding and freshwater plumes. This is further exacerbated by predicted relative sea level rise and global climatic changes. Effective marine resource management of environmental threats requires an understanding of the: (i) present conditions and the ecological response by organisms (ii) future forecasted scenarios; and (iii) long-term historical range in natural variability (HRNV), which conveys the magnitude of modern environmental degradation. To carry this out, a useful ecological indicator(s) is needed. Here, I focus on the (palaeo)ecology of benthic foraminiferal assemblages (Protista) to understand modern, decadal and millennial-scale changes, specifically the: (1) modern relationship between ecology and environment; (2) decadal changes in community structure over the last ~40 years in the lower river estuary and reef environment; and (3) response by benthic foraminifers to long-term, historical (millennial) changes in the subtropical, marginal reef environments of Moreton Bay, southeast Queensland, Australia. From the analysis of 47 surface sediment samples taken from habitats across the Bay, I identified 69 species, three distinct foraminiferal assemblages and six sub-assemblages. I found a positive relationship between foraminiferal assemblages and substrate conditions that resulted in a geographic gradient from: an urban-impacted assemblage in the westernmost part of the Bay, to a hyposaline, estuarine-influenced assemblage in the western Bay to a nearly normal marine to hypersaline assemblage in the eastern Bay. The Foraminifera in Reef Assessment and Monitoring (FORAM) Index of Hallock et al. (2003), which provides a quantitative measurement of reef “health”, was applied and demonstrated marginal conditions. The western Bay foraminiferal assemblages from the estuarine and marginal reef flats reflect high turbidity and variable nutrient conditions, whereas the assemblages from the eastern Bay, near-oceanic, tidal (seagrass-dominated) flats, reflect optimal conditions for zooxanthellate organisms (i.e. corals and large symbiont-bearing foraminifera). Currently, the Brisbane River catchment is experiencing rapid population growth, urbanisation, industrialisation and climate-induced impacts such as the recent major flooding events (i.e. 1974 and 2011). The availability of existing foraminifera samples collected during the 1970s by the Geological Survey of Queensland provide an excellent and rare opportunity to carry out quantitative comparisons between new (2007-08) and existing (1972) data, to assess changes between today and ~40 years ago. I compared community structure between the two time periods and across two different environments: the lower Brisbane River estuary and the adjacent lagoonal-reef flats of Waterloo Bay, in western Moreton Bay. Species diversity and bio-environmental indicators reflect a predominantly human-dominated influence in the lower Brisbane River estuary and reef environments. However, in comparison to the 1970s, recent temporal trends in the foraminiferal assemblages reveal incipient recovery, suggesting potential for remediation of an environment that has previously been influenced by severe anthropogenic modification. This study demonstrates the potential of benthic communities to at least partially recover from severe degradation in nearshore ecosystems. I also examined the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of foraminifera from Holocene sediment cores from three extant Moreton Bay marginal reef sites: Wellington Point, southwest Peel Island and Myora Reef. The foraminiferal assemblages from the three reefs are significantly different from one another, reflecting a W to E spatial gradation (improving eastwards) and a younger to older temporal gradation in water quality and palaeo-water depths. The approximate timing of assemblage shifts with decreasing palaeo-depths over time, generally corresponds with the timing of known faunal and sedimentary patterns associated with the following: regional sea level highstand and progradation of subtidal reefal facies; sea level fall and progradation of shallow-reefal facies; and lastly episodic reefal “turn-off” and progradation of land-derived facies. However, we find that the magnitude of sea level change exceeds known relative sea level change in the region (by a factor of ~1.5-2). The physiographic nature of Moreton Bay, which tends to amplify ecological changes, would have contributed to the higher magnitude of change seen in reefs, throughout the Holocene. Holocene studies also highlight the historical importance of larger benthic symbiont-bearing foraminiferal assemblages (Peneroplis spp. and Alveolinella quoyi/Heterostegina depressa spp.) as indicators of environmental change in Moreton Bay’s reefs. They can be used as a measure of improvement in water quality or as a signal for recovery of environments, particularly in the western Bay reefs. Lastly, this study demonstrates a clear response by benthic foraminiferal assemblages to changes in sea level throughout the Holocene. It suggests that Moreton Bay’s reefs have endured natural instability and gradual, progressive change over a time frame of ~7000 years. In contrast, more recent anthropogenically-driven changes affecting water quality, have resulted in dramatic shifts in the benthic ecological assemblages of Moreton Bay in a shorter time-frame of ~200 years."

    "text": "Research interests\nSymbiosis ecology, bio-geography and evolution. Environmental tolerance ranges and specificity of larval and juvenile corals. Adaptation in reef corals, and species range shifts.\n\n\n\nCurrent research\nClimate change is predicted to drive tropical reef corals towards high latitude communities. Past evidence indicates that these high latitude coral communities can act as refugia and sources of evolutionary novelty. At present information on high latitude coral reefs and their associated symbiont communities remains sparse. In my current research I aim to address some of the questions pertaining to the potential of reef corals to move into higher latitudes by studying subtropical and high-latitude coral communities along the eastern Australian coast. I will specifically assess the: a) level of overlap between tropical and high-latitude communities in terms of coral symbioses, b) presence of genetic breaks, c) influence of coral reproductive mode, symbiont strategy, and symbiont transmission on species ranges. I will further experimentally modulate symbiotic partnerships under various climate scenarios to get an insight into the potential for generational changes in coral-symbiont partnerships. This data provides a step forward to understand the potential of reef corals to move current species ranges, and ties in with ongoing research on ecological dynamics of fish, coral and echinoderm assemblages at high latitude reefs and established research priorities (www.susra.org) for conservation of subtropical reefs under the pressure of climate change.\n\n\n\nEducation\nPost-doctoral Research Fellow, The Pennsylvania State University, USA, 2010\nPost-doctoral Research Fellow, The University of Queensland, Australia, 2008\nPhD, “Diversity and Ecology of Symbiodinium in pocilloporid corals”, The University of Queensland, Australia, 2007\nMSc, “Reproduction and speciation in the coral genus Madracis“, The University of Groningen, Netherlands, 2000\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nSampayo EM, Roff G, Sims C, Rachello-Dolmen P, Pandolfi JM (2020).

Reimer at the University of the Ryukyus and many other colleagues in Japan and Australia, I am interested in finding commonalities and differences in transitional reef communities between the northern and the southern hemisphere.

Highly connected to their neighbouring tropical coral reefs, high-latitude subtropical reefs host transitional communities characterised by a biogeographical overlap of tropical, subtropical and temperate species. They occur in distinct marine ecoregions as shown in this map.\nIn collaboration with John Pandolfi and Brigitte Sommer, I examine seasonal changes in communities of fishes, benthos and invertebrates on subtropical reefs from the Southern GBR to central NSW.\nSubtropical reefs are threatened by both a changing climate and urbanisation. Their role as potential refugia for tropical species gives them high conservation and management priority, but conservation decisions are still hampered by our lack knowledge about them, and how to use it.

    "text": "I am a community and quantitative ecologist whose research explores community ecology questions in a range of taxa and systems. I am particularly interested in the application of functional traits and statistical techniques to improve our understanding of how natural communities form and function, and how they change over time.\nMy past research has examined mechanisms of coexistence between closely-related wildflower species, the relationship between species diversity and primary productivity in reforestation plantings, whether evolutionary context alters relationships between plant functional traits and growth rate, and predicting whether reforestation efforts are likely to develop expected conservation and carbon storage benefits.\nI am also interested in the research habits of ecologists, particularly in their publication and citation habits. I have been involved in a collaborative project examining the use of community ecology theory in restoration ecology experiments. I have also examined the interconnectivity in applied ecology more generally by web scraping publication and citation data.\n\n\nCurrent research\nMy current research in the Marine Paleoecology lab is focused on using datasets of fossil coral to study communities over large time periods, something that is nearly impossible for communities of other long-lived taxa (e.g., trees). Some of my research projects include studying patterns of co-occurrence between coral, both community membership and actual interactions, and with PhD student Malyon Bimler, whether theoretical concepts of community stability are realistic for real-world community data.\n\n\n\nRecent publications\nStaples TL, Mayfield MM, England JR and Dwyer JM (2019).
