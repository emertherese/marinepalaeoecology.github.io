    "text": "Steve Dalton is a post-doctoral researcher in the School of Biological Sciences University of Queensland. Steve received a PhD in Marine Science and Management from the University of New England, Armidale NSW.\nSteve has extensive knowledge of marine habitats along the NSW and southern QLD coastline and is currently undertaking research focussed on assessing the potential for tropical coral species migration to higher latitudes and understanding the mechanisms that enable warm water coral specialist to grow and persist at marginal reefs along the eastern seaboard. This work aims to assess the influence of elemental stoichiometry in corals and their symbionts in determining how changes in metabolic rates might define latitudinal limits in the distribution of reef corals.\nSteve is committed to understanding the implications of threats to subtropical marine environments, which will help to develop management strategies and educational programs to ensure future reef stability and longevity. Steve’s contribution to local projects, which engage community and government agency support, continue to build on the region’s capacity to undertake marine research.\n\n\nEducation\nResearch Scientist, Shark Research, Department of Primary Industries, Coffs Harbour NSW\nPost-doctoral Research Fellow, Southern Cross University, Coffs Harbour NSW\nPhD, University of New England, Armidale, NSW\nFirst Class Honours, University of New England, Armidale NSW\n\n\n\nCurrent research\nSteve’s PhD research focused on assessing threats to subtropical marine communities, with particular emphasis on hard corals associated with reefs throughout northern New South Wales. This research identified an infectious disease that was termed Australian Subtropical White Syndrome. It provided a comprehensive assessment of the impact thermal stress and disease had on hard coral communities throughout the region. These observations established baseline data for comparison following a significant coral-bleaching event at Lord Howe Island (LHI) in 2010. A current collaborative project is assessing the resilience potential of hard corals to combat repeated thermal stress events. This ongoing research at LHI is the first project to document the impacts of successive thermal bleaching events and will provide important information regarding the ability of thermally vulnerable coral species to persist in a warmer climate, where bleaching episodes are predicted to occur annually by 2050.\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nHughes, T.P., Dalton, S.

Past evidence indicates that these high latitude coral communities can act as refugia and sources of evolutionary novelty. At present information on high latitude coral reefs and their associated symbiont communities remains sparse. In my current research I aim to address some of the questions pertaining to the potential of reef corals to move into higher latitudes by studying subtropical and high-latitude coral communities along the eastern Australian coast. I will specifically assess the: a) level of overlap between tropical and high-latitude communities in terms of coral symbioses, b) presence of genetic breaks, c) influence of coral reproductive mode, symbiont strategy, and symbiont transmission on species ranges. I will further experimentally modulate symbiotic partnerships under various climate scenarios to get an insight into the potential for generational changes in coral-symbiont partnerships. This data provides a step forward to understand the potential of reef corals to move current species ranges, and ties in with ongoing research on ecological dynamics of fish, coral and echinoderm assemblages at high latitude reefs and established research priorities (www.susra.org) for conservation of subtropical reefs under the pressure of climate change.\n\n\n\nPublications\nSampayo EM, Roff G, Sims C, Rachello-Dolmen P, Pandolfi JM (2020).

Modification of coastal habitats and intense agriculture resulted in increased runoff into adjacent rivers and estuarine waterways, subsequently polluting the GBR. This agricultural waste has caused eutrophication and terrigenous sedimentation, resulting in decreased water quality. In response to this, coral reefs have undergone rapid degradation. This project aims to investigate whether bioeroders have increased in abundance and diversity, both spatially and temporally, across a water quality gradient on the GBR, relative to anthropogenic perturbations.

In Moreton Bay (27º25S, 152º20E), Australia, commercial and recreational fishing activities have intensified since the onset of European settlement, nearly 200 years ago. However, the total impacts that these practices have had on fish communities are difficult to discern due to the lack of understanding of long-term historical baselines. To recognise the major drivers of ecological change and degradation of coastal marine ecosystems, whether natural and/or anthropogenic, requires an understanding of the baseline or natural conditions prior to any major anthropogenic exploitation. To determine the baseline conditions of fish community structure in a marine ecosystem, a useful ecological indicator is needed. This study uses microscopic fish teeth as a proxy to reconstruct the baseline structure of fish functional groups in Moreton Bay, Southeast Queensland, Australia, prior to and post European settlement. Fish teeth were picked from core and surface sediments from three sites across Moreton Bay (Wellington Point, Peel Island and Myora Reef) to analyse patterns in temporal and spatial scales of fish functional groups. We found a general increase in the number of fish teeth in more recent sediment samples, highlighting possible taphonomic (preservational) effects. No significant difference in fish community structure was observed among sites in Moreton Bay. However, a significant temporal change in the relative abundance of functional groups was observed: 1) between 0CE to 999CE and 1000CE to 1999CE; and 2) between 2000BCE to 1001BCE and 1000CE to 1999CE. Fishing activities in the past 2000 years in Moreton Bay appear to have had minimal impacts on the functional structure of fish communities; however, the impact of changing environmental conditions, resulting in variation in coral reef accretion, may be a likely factor influencing the changes in functional composition of fish communities through time."

This study provides the first time-series comparison of catch and effort in Moreton Bay’s mixed-species recreational fishery, focusing on; Sillago maculata (diver whiting), Pagrus auratus (pink snapper), and Portunus armatus (blue swimmer crab). Access-point surveys were undertaken in Moreton Bay in 2013, and compared with surveys conducted using the same methodology in 1994/1995 and 1999. Diver whiting catch rates have significantly declined over the time-series, despite a regulatory change banning this species in commercial trawler bycatch, which was expected to increase productivity and catch rate. Snapper catch rates were consistent between 1994 and 2013, however a significantly greater catch rate in 1999 may have captured a ‘pulse’ increase in snapper abundance. Hyperstability could be occurring in this snapper fishery, with anglers potentially fishing down a declining stock. Size structure of snapper and diver whiting showed greater proportions in larger size classes in 2013 than past years, which for snapper is likely due to restrictive size limits. Mean length of the two species has significantly increased over time. Blue swimmer crabs showed opposite trends, with smaller proportions in larger size classes and a smaller mean carapace width in 2013. Human dimensions of these fisheries were examined in 2013, providing a baseline for future research. This study highlights the importance of time-series comparisons in identifying temporal trends, and may assist in sustainable management of recreational fisheries and fish stocks."

To explore the effects of both anthropogenic processes including, land-­use change, urban and industrial growth and natural process including ENSO, rainfall, weathering and sea level variation on the environments of Moreton Bay, the geochemical analyses of four massive corals from the bay was conducted. The geochemical analysis of annual growth bands of coral colonies of species Favia speciosa and Plesiastrea versipora using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-­MS), allowed for the development of a proxy record of environmental change in Moreton Bay spanning from 1942 to the present. Cores of a Plesiastrea versipora from Peel Island and a Favia speciosa from Goat and Peel Island were collected on the 28/6/2011. A core sample of a Favia speciosa collected from Wellington Point in 1997 and a fossil of the same species from Cleveland Point were also incorporated into this study. Trends in trace metals (Mn, Zn, Sn, Cu, Fe, Pb, rare earth elements, and yttrium concentrations (La Ce Pr Nd Sm Eu Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu and Y) were measured, with chronologies developed from X-­ray densitometry and U-­Th dating. Annual trends in metal concentration were highly variable, with few long-­term trends. Comparisons of rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) concentrations in coral cores from western and eastern Moreton Bay indicated a strong terrestrial-­marine environmental gradient characterized by hypo-­saline turbid waters in western Moreton Bay at Wellington Point to more oceanic water in eastern Moreton Bay at Peel and Goat Island. Decadal REY oscillations measured in P. versipora where predominantly driven by rainfall variation in the Brisbane river catchment, resulting in decadal trends of decreased river influence in southern Moreton Bay between 1942 and 2011. Completion of Wivenhoe Dam in the upper Brisbane river catchment in 1981 resulted in a decrease in discharge variability of the Brisbane River. This is shown in a drop in total REY concentrations in modern corals of Eastern Moreton Bay. Sea level rise is also discussed as potential driver of this decrease. Mid-­Holocene (6ka) Cleveland point was characterized by high river influence comparable with modern Wellington point, but with less environmental variability through time. This study highlights the strong environmental gradients in the bay, driven by tidal currents and catchment process, and their possible interaction with biological aspects of the Bay, including the potential for localized coral growth."

The significant decrease observed in the mid 19th century corresponds to the European settlement as well as the end of the Little Ice Age. Before this breaking point, calcification is driven by sea surface temperature showing an inverse relationship trend. It is possible that the effect of European settlement on calcification could be explained among other by sedimentation and river discharge. Also the end of the LIA announced drastic changes in temperature. This period is a transition between a cold period and global warming. However the response of corals is still to discover yet."

We sampled the relative species abundance of coral, benthic foraminifera, and calcareous red algae communities from eight submerged coral reefs in the Huon Gulf, Papua New Guinea, which formed during successive sea level fall and lowstand periods over the past ;416 kyr. We found that dissimilarity in coral species composition increased significantly with increasing time between reef-building events. However, neither coral diversity nor the taxonomic composition of benthic foraminifera and calcareous red algae assemblages varied significantly over time. The taxonomic composition of coral communities from lowstand reefs was significantly different from that of highstand reefs previously reported from the nearby Huon Peninsula. We interpret the community composition and temporal dynamics of lowstand reefs as a result of shifting energy regimes in the Huon Gulf, and differences between low and highstand reefs as a result of differences in the interaction between biotic and environmental factors between the Huon Gulf and Huon Peninsula. Regardless of the exact processes driving these trends, our study represents the first glimpse into the ecological dynamics of coral reefs during low sea level stands when climatic conditions for reef growth were much different and less optimal than during previously studied highstand periods."

    "text": "Dean Blower\ndean.blower@uqconnect.edu.au\nDespite the international and regional protection of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), measures fundamental to monitoring their conservation status, population size, genetic population structure and genetic diversity, have not been established. Tissue sourced from predominately juvenile white sharks of five Australian regions was sequenced for the mtDNA control region and genotyped with six nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci. Maternally inherited population structure was found between all regions, suggesting regional natal philopatry, and was also found between the east and south/west coasts, which concords with recent tracking data from satellite and acoustic tags, that indicates the presence of east coast white shark nurseries. Finding genetic population subdivision with both maternally and bi-parentally inherited markers suggests that both genders exhibit degrees of regional philopatry and that males are not panmictic as previously supposed. In contrast, five sharks captured on the east coast proved to have haplotypes that resemble western Indian Ocean sharks more closely than Australian and New Zealand sharks. Estimates of long-term genetic effective population size from microsatellite loci indicate that an extensive ancestral white shark population once existed. Contemporary estimates of genetic effective population size suggest a breeding population in Australian waters greater than commonly accepted thresholds for inbreeding and loss of adaptive potential. However, unmonitored population decline could expose these genetically populations isolated to precipitous loss of genetic diversity. Therefore, we suggest that the current level of international and regional protection of white sharks is appropriate but that populations should be investigated in more detail."

    "text": "I am a PhD student under the supervision of Professor John Pandolfi and Dr Timothy Staples. I joined the Marine Palaeoecology lab in June 2019 as a Winter Research Scholar, working with PhD student Carolina Chong-Montenegro to reconstruct historical fisheries records of species along the Queensland coast. Since then, I remained in the lab as a volunteer researcher. Concurrent with my undergraduate degree, I worked independently and collaboratively on a range of projects across multiple disciplines including historical ecology, marine biology, and geology.\nIn December 2021, I graduated from The University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours). For my Honours project, I quantified patterns in taxonomic and functional ecological novelty in historical Queensland coral communities under the supervision of Prof Pandolfi and Dr Staples. I will continue studying ecological novelty in marine ecosystems throughout my PhD, which I started in January 2022.\nI love learning and teaching science; when I’m not reading the literature or troubleshooting my code, you might find me on campus tutoring wide audiences about science – whether I’m surveying sclerophyll forest with high school students or chatting about turtle skulls with second-year zoologists.\n\n\nResearch interests\nCoastal and marine ecosystems, ecology of coral reefs, temporal and spatial scale in ecology.\n\n\n\nCurrent research\nDrivers and consequences of novel marine ecological communities\nEarth’s ecological assemblages are rapidly being driven towards unprecedented, “novel” states. Novel communities are often defined by their unexpected species compositions; under human activities, ecologists and managers are increasingly interested in how this novelty emerges and impacts our planet. We know little about ecological novelty in our oceans, despite evidence that modern marine communities are experiencing greater rates and magnitudes of change than both modern terrestrial ecosystems and historical marine ecosystems. In my PhD, I aim to uncover patterns in marine ecological novelty across space and time, and shed light on their drivers and consequences. It is important to quantitatively assess novel marine ecological communities as we anticipate their increasing emergence under ongoing and exacerbating environmental change."

The subtropical-to-temperate transition zones in eastern Australia and Japan harbour a unique combination of tropical, subtropical and temperate taxa, including corals at their high-latitude range limits. Primarily non-reefal coral communities occur in pockets of suitable habitat and extend to high latitudes. They are regarded as potential refuge habitats for tropical species as they become threatened by global warming, however increased ecological understanding of the mechanism that structure them is required before these and similar questions can be properly assessed. My research aims to address some of these knowledge gaps. I use a combination of primary data collection, trait-based, phylogenetic community ecology and statistical modelling approaches to investigate ecological dynamics at biogeographic transition zones in Australia and Japan.\n\n\n\nSelected publications\nKim S.W., Sampayo E., Sommer B., Sims C., Gómez-Cabrera M., Dalton S., Beger M., Malcolm H., Ferrari R., Fraser N., Figueira W., Smith S.D.A., Heron S., Baird A., Byrne M., Eakin M., Edgar G., Hughes T., Kyriacou N., Liu G., Matis P., Skirving W., Pandolfi J.M.

Highly connected to their neighbouring tropical coral reefs, high-latitude subtropical reefs host transitional communities characterised by a biogeographical overlap of tropical, subtropical and temperate species. They occur in distinct marine ecoregions as shown in this map.\nIn collaboration with John Pandolfi and Brigitte Sommer, I examine seasonal changes in communities of fishes, benthos and invertebrates on subtropical reefs from the Southern GBR to central NSW.\nSubtropical reefs are threatened by both a changing climate and urbanisation. Their role as potential refugia for tropical species gives them high conservation and management priority, but conservation decisions are still hampered by our lack knowledge about them, and how to use it.

    "text": "I am a community and quantitative ecologist whose research explores community ecology questions in a range of taxa and systems. I am particularly interested in the application of functional traits and statistical techniques to improve our understanding of how natural communities form and function, and how they change over time.\nMy past research has examined mechanisms of coexistence between closely-related wildflower species, the relationship between species diversity and primary productivity in reforestation plantings, whether evolutionary context alters relationships between plant functional traits and growth rate, and predicting whether reforestation efforts are likely to develop expected conservation and carbon storage benefits.\nI am also interested in the research habits of ecologists, particularly in their publication and citation habits. I have been involved in a collaborative project examining the use of community ecology theory in restoration ecology experiments. I have also examined the interconnectivity in applied ecology more generally by web scraping publication and citation data.\n\n\nCurrent research\nMy current research in the Marine Paleoecology lab is focused on using datasets of fossil coral to study communities over large time periods, something that is nearly impossible for communities of other long-lived taxa (e.g., trees). Some of my research projects include studying patterns of co-occurrence between coral, both community membership and actual interactions, and with PhD student Malyon Bimler, whether theoretical concepts of community stability are realistic for real-world community data.\n\n\n\nRecent publications\nStaples TL, Mayfield MM, England JR and Dwyer JM (2019).
