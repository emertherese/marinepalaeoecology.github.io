I’ve always been fascinated with marine ecosystems and larger underlying processes that cause systems to change and adapt. During my bachelor and master, I’ve been involved in research projects from crustacean-ciliate symbioses in Dutch waters to dinoflagellate cysts and pollen in the Mediterranean sapropels, as well as genetic diversity and connectivity of Symbiodinium in high latitude reefs along the Australian coast. I now combine much of my previous experience and interests in my PhD where I aim to add an extra dimension to the reconstruction of past coral reefs, their community structure and coral-algal phase shifts using ancient DNA.

### Research interests

Marine ecosystems, paleoecology, evolution, biogeography, genetics, algae, symbioses.

### Current research

Reconstructing past phase shifts in coral reef communities using ancient DNA.
