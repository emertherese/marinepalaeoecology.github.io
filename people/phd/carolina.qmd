Carolina is a marine fisheries ecologist focusing on historical fisheries of rare and threatened fish species. She received her bachelor’s degree in marine biology from ESPOL in Ecuador, where she studied the ecology and biology an endemic grouper of the Galápagos Islands, then received her master’s degree at the University of Bremen, Germany, where she studied the biology and fisheries of the Pacific goliath grouper in Colombia. Her work focuses on documenting the historical impact of fishing on vulnerable fish populations and aims to actively integrate local communities into the research process by apply interdisciplinary approaches for developing sustainable fisheries.
