### Research interests

I am interested in long-term ecosystem dynamics. Particularly, in disentangling natural from anthropogenic sources of variation in ecological and geomorphological attributes of coral reefs in the face of ongoing human-induced environmental change.

### Current research

*Long term dynamics of coral reefs in the inshore southern Great Barrier Reef.*

(a) To evaluate the suitability of a high latitude reef system to serve as a refugium for reef organisms escaping a warming ocean;

(b) to test for equal vertical accretion rates through space, across local reef habitats, and through time, over millennial time-scales spanning environmental conditions that encompass those projected for the upcoming decades;

(c) to test for persistent reef-building coral community composition across the mid-Holocene (8–4 ka), the late-Holocene (4–0 ka) and the modern (live coral), and to evaluate the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes of community assembly.
