### Current research

*Reconstructing ecological baselines: Historical changes in fisheries*

Wild caught fisheries are declining worldwide and are facing unprecedented challenges due to increasing unsustainable levels of exploitation, destructive fishing practices, pollution and coastal development. However, without an understanding of historical ecological baselines, fisheries managers underestimate exploited fish population abundance and status.My research focuses on using historical, social and ecological techniques to provide baselines of former population sizes against which current populations can be benchmarked. This study will integrate long-term patterns of change in fisheries abundance and distribution, analysis of the relative impacts of resource user groups (commercial, recreational and Indigenous) and statistical models to identify whether exploited fish populations are managed at sustainable levels. Specifically this research aims to: 1) track the trajectory of a suite of Moreton Bay fin fisheries abundances since the Holocene; 2) reconstruct the history of the Australian east coast Spanish mackerel fishery as a specific case study to determine the relative impact of both commercial and recreational fishing sectors over time; and 3) assessing Kenya’s historically exploited coral reef fish species susceptibility to extinction.This project will be the first to provide a long-term reconstruction and baseline of exploited Queensland’s fish populations using an interdisciplinary approach. It will contribute to a broader understanding of fisheries and provide important baseline information for managers concerned about maintaining fishery resources at a sustainable level.
