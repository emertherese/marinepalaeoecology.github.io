### Current research

*Saving the undersea giants: ecosystem-based management of exploited brown-marbled grouper spawning aggregations in Papua New Guinea.*

The ultimate goal of the project is the implementation of sustainable, ecosystem-based co-management of a population of brown-marbled grouper (listed as ‘Near Threatened’ on the IUCN red list) in Papua New Guinea. The population forms a large spawning aggregation, where hundreds of sexually mature individuals of this and two other charismatic species converge en-masse to participate in spectacular displays of courtship. In addition to their natural and aesthetic value, spawning aggregations are particularly valuable to local fisher communities, for both subsistence and income. Unfortunately, aggregations are also extremely vulnerable to overfishing, and slow to recover. Through unsustainable fishing and ineffective management, around 80% of studied spawning aggregations worldwide are in decline or have disappeared entirely, devastating local communities and coral reef ecosystems. This project will utilise new and existing partnerships, and proven scientific techniques, to fill vital knowledge gaps about adult movement patterns, larval replenishment, population demographics and local socioeconomic conditions to facilitate the sustainable management of this high-value, charismatic species.
