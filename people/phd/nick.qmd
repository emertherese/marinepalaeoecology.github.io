Nick joined the lab in April of 2018. He is originally from the United States where he obtained his Bachelors in Marine Science at Roger Williams University and then completed his Masters in Biological Oceanography at the University of Puerto Rico, Department of Marine Sciences. His work mostly dealt with population genetics, coral/sponge species interactions and mesophotic reef ecology.

### Current research

The fossil record is an indispensable repository for understanding how organisms respond to their changing biotic and abiotic environment over multiple temporal scales. By studying the fossil record, scientists can observe long term changes in community structure in relation to climatic variability, both induced naturally and anthropogenically. Coral-related paleoecology is extremely insightful, since many Cnidaria secrete calcified skeletons at or near isotopic equilibrium with surrounding seawater, and thus can be used as proxies to reconstruct environmental conditions over geological time. In addition, their calcified skeletons are ideal for fossilization and often become embedded and preserved in the limestone bedrock they create, leaving behind a comprehensive mosaic of life histories and community composition. Given the current backdrop of climate change and deleterious phase shifts on coral reefs, paleoecological analysis of Holocene and Pleistocene reef deposits can provide historical and ecological baselines with which to compare modern coral reef decline. By comparing recent with past ecological histories, I aim to identify the ecological drivers that lead to coral phase shifts and to what degree coral reefs within the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia have changed over the past century. In situ surveys will be augmented with sediment cores to infer an even deeper perspective into the coral history of the region.
