I am a PhD student under the supervision of Professor John Pandolfi (Marine Palaeoecology Lab), Associate Professor Margie Mayfield (Community Ecology Lab) and Dr Eugenia Sampayo (Marine Palaeoecology Lab).

---

### Research interests

Coral reefs, community ecology, coral recruitment, biodiversity, symbioses, biogeography, dispersal, connectivity, evolution.

### Current research

Coral reef structures support an incredible diversity of life and are often called “rainforests of the sea”. Just like rainforests, they have spurred decades of debates and theories among community ecologists to understand what promotes coexistence among apparently similar species and maintains such high levels of diversity. However, the theory for coral reef communities is largely lacking in comparison to its terrestrial counterparts.

My PhD research aims to investigate a fundamental ecological theory, the Janzen-Connell Hypothesis, to highlight aspects that are increasingly being shown to be of importance in coral community ecology. Specifically the role of species interactions during coral recruitment.

During my candidature, I have collaborated on a number of other studies or field research including:

- National Bleaching Taskforce, subtropical coral bleaching 2016/2017 – surveys of mortality and recovery, co-author (paper under revision)
- Coral community demographics of subtropical communities – annual surveys of tagged colonies, data collection, co-author
- ARC Discovery Grant: An elemental hypothesis for sub-tropical refugia in reef corals – field assistance
- Coral larval settlement under space limitation – field assistance, data collection, co-author (paper in prep)
- Effect of cleaner fish on local ectoparasite populations of coral reefs, 12-year study – data collection (prior to candidature), co-author (paper under revision)
- I have also been a councillor with the Australian Coral Reef Society for four years, and am currently serving my second term as Secretary.
