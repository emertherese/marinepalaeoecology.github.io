### Current research

*Ecological Dynamics of Pleistocene reef corals*

In response to the interaction of diverse natural and anthropogenic influences, modern ecosystems are experiencing novel changes in assemblage composition, distribution, and functionality. Predicting and managing for such changes requires a long-term ecological perspective of ecosystem variability and adaptability. As an ecological archive of geohistorical data, the fossil record provides this temporal perspective. Therefore, using the fossil record, this project tested hypotheses related to the timing, trends, and drivers of ecosystem development, assemblage composition, and species distributions of scleractinian corals during the Middle – Late Pleistocene. This time interval is significant because it represents a time when the Earth’s climate was in a state of transition and environmental change.

The Middle – Late Pleistocene (~1.0 – 0.01 Ma) climate is characterized by the intensification of cyclic oscillations between glacial (cool, low sea level) and interglacial (warm, high sea level) intervals. The fossil record, preserving a long-term dataset of coral reef communities composed of extant species, reveals that reef corals have persisted throughout the Pleistocene despite these multiple dramatic climate fluctuations, some of which are similar in magnitude to modern climate change. Although it provides a valuable ecologic resource, the Early – Late Pleistocene history of coral reef ecology remains largely unexplored, particularly in relation to climate changes during this critical period of reef expansion, and persistence, into modern reef ecosystems.

Overall, this thesis identified long-term ecological trends in shallow-water coral ecosystem development and deep-water coral diversity and distribution in relation to local, regional, and or global environmental variables during the Middle – Late Pleistocene, when the amplitude of glacial-interglacial cycles were intensifying into the modern climate regime. These results provide new insights to the natural variability of coral ecosystems and their capacity to respond to environmental conditions or changes operating on local to global scales. Such knowledge may improve our predictions about the future of coral ecosystems and their ability to cope with current and anticipated environmental changes.
