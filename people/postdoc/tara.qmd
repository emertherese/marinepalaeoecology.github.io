Tara R. Clark is a geochemist and marine palaeoecologist in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Queensland. Tara received a Bachelor of Science (Hons) at the University of New England, Armidale, and a PhD from the University of Queensland, Brisbane.

Tara’s early and current research is primarily focused on human impacts on the marine environment. After the completion of her undergraduate studies in 2005, she investigated the effects of nutrient enrichment on seagrass macroinvertebrate communities during Honours at the National Marine Science Centre in Coffs Harbour. The importance of this study was reflected in the need to assess the effects of increasing nutrient enrichment in coastal waters, from point and non-point sources, as a result of human population expansion and increased urban development on the NSW mid-north coast.

Tara is now continuing to work on historical ecological and environmental changes on the GBR as a Research Officer on the National Environmental Research Program (NERP) funded project ‘Characterising the cumulative impacts of global, regional and local stressors on the present and past biodiversity of the GBR’.

### Current research

During her doctoral research, Tara investigated the history of mortality events of inshore reef coral communities within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) since European settlement. While the GBR is considered to be one of the least degraded coral reefs in the world, increasing evidence suggests that this may not be the case with a 50.7% loss of coral cover since 1985 on mid-shelf and offshore reefs (see De’ath et al. 2012 PNAS 109: 17995-17999). With detailed knowledge of the GBR limited to the past 25yrs, little is known of the past changes in coral communities since European settlement and the onset of anthropogenic disturbance. This research used highly precise uranium-series (U-series) thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC ICP-MS) dating of dead Acropora coral rubble (death assemblage) and massive Porites from inshore reef environments influenced by terrestrial runoff and high sea surface temperatures, to provide an accurate chronology on the timing of historical mortality events prior to the advent of long-term monitoring. Such baseline knowledge is critical when assessing the current status of the GBR and setting restoration targets.
