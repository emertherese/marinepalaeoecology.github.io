### Current research

*Reef communities and their conservation on the tropical – temperate latitudinal gradient: Japan*

In collaboration with J.D. Reimer at the University of the Ryukyus and many other colleagues in Japan and Australia, I am interested in finding commonalities and differences in transitional reef communities between the northern and the southern hemisphere.  In June/ July 2015, we are in the field collecting data, ranging from Tateyama (~35 deg N) to Iriomote Island (~23 deg N), with a team of 5 including Brigitte!

*Ecological dynamics and conservation of subtropical coral reef communities of east Australia in changing climate*

This project aims to benchmark and conserve the dynamics of subtropical reefs; personally I am biased towards fishes and changes in their functional roles along the latitudinal gradient.  Highly connected to their neighbouring tropical coral reefs, high-latitude subtropical reefs host transitional communities characterised by a biogeographical overlap of tropical, subtropical and temperate species. They occur in distinct marine ecoregions as shown in this map.

In collaboration with John Pandolfi and Brigitte Sommer, I examine seasonal changes in communities of fishes, benthos and invertebrates on subtropical reefs from the Southern GBR to central NSW.

Subtropical reefs are threatened by both a changing climate and urbanisation. Their role as potential refugia for tropical species gives them high conservation and management priority, but conservation decisions are still hampered by our lack knowledge about them, and how to use it.  In a workshop of subtropical reef researchers and managers in August 2010 we identified [seven research priorities](www.susra.org) for subtropical reefs to enhance their conservation under climate change.
